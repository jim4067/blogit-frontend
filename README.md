# BLOGIT

![logo-test](public/readme-banner.png)

Hi there and welcome!

This is the front end part of the Blogit web application. Blogit is a web app that allows a user to save applications that He/She came across the internet. No need to have thousands of bookmarks or tabs of blogs that you intend to read in Chrome, Let blogit do that for you. Sign in and let blogit save that blog that your are most certainly never going to read.

## About the app

This app is part of the exercises from the [fullstackopen] course from the University of Helsinki with some added feature from yours truly. The app is built using the react framework. Various components manage the views for the app. Styling is done using CSS modules and styled components. The logic for handling the state of the application is built using redux with a few components using react's state-hook. Unit test were performed using Jest while end to end testing was performed using Cypress.

## Running the app locally

To run this app locally make sure you have git, node and a \*nix os (Just kidding, but development on Windows can sometimes be nightmare).
Clone this repo and install all the dependencies and finally, run the 'dev' npm script.

```
git clone https://github.com/jim4067/blogit-frontend.git
cd blogit
npm install
npm run dev
```
